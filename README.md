# Restaurant Homepage Project

This project is a dynamic restaurant homepage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to showcase the skills of creating and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) 
with JavaScript to generate the entire contents of a website.

## Description

The Restaurant Homepage Project demonstrates the creation of a website using JavaScript to dynamically render content. The project follows a modular approach, where different 
sections of the website (homepage, contact page, and menu page) are created as separate modules and then integrated using JavaScript.

## Techniques Used

- Utilized the `createDocumentFragment()` method to hold items in a virtual container before appending them to the live DOM.
- Employed modular JavaScript to create separate page modules and achieve code organization.
- Dynamically switched between different sections of the website using event listeners and DOM manipulation.

## What I Have Learned

Through this project, I have gained experience in handling DOM manipulation using JavaScript, creating modular and reusable code, and integrating multiple parts of a website seamlessly. I've also learned about using Webpack for bundling JavaScript files and creating a more efficient development workflow.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm are required to manage project dependencies and run scripts.
- Webpack is used for bundling the JavaScript modules.
- CSS files are used for styling, while JavaScript handles DOM manipulation.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Usage

1. Modify the JavaScript module files (homepage.js, contact.js, menu.js) to customize the content of each page.
2. Run `npm run build` to bundle the JavaScript files using Webpack.
3. Open the `dist/index.html` file in a web browser to view the dynamically generated website.

## Demo

You can find a live demo of the project [here](link-to-live-demo).
